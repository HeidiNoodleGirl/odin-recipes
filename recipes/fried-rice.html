        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Fried Rice has to be one of my all time favorite takeout inspired dishes to make at home. It’s easier to control the saltiness, sweetness and to bump up the veggies when you make it at home!</p>
        <p>Our family makes this fried rice recipe at least once a week with whatever vegetables we have on hand. It is always the perfect accompaniment to my take out style dishes.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Veggies</li>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by heating 1 tablespoon of butter into a large skillet. Add the eggs and scramble until fully cooked.</li>
            <li>Remove them from the pan and set aside. Add the remaining tablespoon of butter into the pan. Add carrots and onion to the pan and cook until tender, 3-4 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for an additional minute.</li>
            <li>Add in the cold rice and peas and sauté for 3-4 minutes. The rice should brown up a bit.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs back to the pan and stir in soy sauce, oyster sauce and sesame oil. Cook for 1-2 minutes to heat through. Serve immediately with green onions for garnish, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
